# bbCodeWebEx
A Webextensions Version of the Firefox extension bbCodeXtra, which is legacy (pre Quantum) extension.

This uses the context menu to automate the insertion of various codes (bbCode, HTML, XHTML, Vbulletin, Markdown) using a context menu.

Currently in pre alpha development.

## Firefox Versions
This extension supports Firefox 57 and above.

## Customization
Users will be able to create their own custom tags and symbols as well as turning on and off code menus.  (Not yet implemented)

## Health Warning
This is profoundly ugly code, and the author assumes no responsibility for any of the following conditions that might develop as a result:

Seriously, this is Vogon code Javascript.
