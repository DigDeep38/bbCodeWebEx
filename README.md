# bbCodeWebEx
A Webextensions Version of the Firefox extension bbCodeXtra, which is legacy (pre Quantum) extension.

This uses the context menu to automate the insertion of various codes (bbCode, HTML, XHTML, Vbulletin, Markdown) using a context menu.

Currently in pre alpha development.

## Firefox Versions
This extension supports Firefox 57 and above.

## Customization
Users will be able to create their own custom tags and symbols as well as turning on and off code menus.  (Not yet implemented)

## Acknowledgements
#### Francesco Lodolo \[:flod]
Wrote the program bbCodeXtra (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bbcodextra/),
which (with his permission) this program hews to as closely as possible.

Additionally, I am using the internatinal language codes he maintained for bbCodeXtra, as well as an almost direct copy of the code he used to generate lists.

#### Niklas Gollenstede \[NilkasG]
Wrote the code used to access the contents of the clipboard, available at https://github.com/NiklasGollenstede/es6lib/, specifically the dom.js file.

#### Erosman
Used his code snipped to do internationalization on my options pages.  https://github.com/erosman/HTML-Internationalization
