Who wrote the program bbCodeXtra (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bbcodextra/),
which this program hews to as closely as possible.

I have with his permission.

The code dealing with lists is a marginally modified copy of what is in his bbCodeXtra.

I have attempted duplicate the basic menu structure to the maximum degree, but the 
custom tags use a different syntax.

To read the contents of the clipboard, I have used slightly modified the code from
Skim the clipboard (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/skim-the-clipboard/)
developed by François Rappaz (rappazf).

End Acknowledgements:

Quick instructions:  (there are more on the settings page)

To back up the custom tags, just copy to a text file from the dialogue box on the settings page, and save it.

Warning:  This is profoundly ugly code.  A detailed inspection while sober may result in:
    * Insanity
    * Sterility
    * Impotence
    * Hair in the palm of the hands
    * Listening to Nickelback
    * The wrath of the Flying Spaghetti monster.
    * Your large intestine leaping up and throttling your brain in an attempt to save
      life itself.  (Apologies to Douglas Adams)

More seriously, I know that my coding is complete junk, and my only virtue is sheer bloody 
mindedness, which makes this the equivalent of Vogon JavaScript.
