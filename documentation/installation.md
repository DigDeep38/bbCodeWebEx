# Installation Instructions

The file has not yet been installed in addons.mozilla.org, so you must do one of the following:
* Download the zip file from GitHub, and rename from \*.zip to \*.xpi, and then load it from the about:debugging page by clicking on the page.
* Download the zip file from GitHub, unzip it into a directory, and then then load it from the about:debugging page by clicking on the manifest.JSON file in that directory.
* Download a privately signed file from Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x-Iof29t_8GGM75zKjpTN39mI96KNKgO?usp=sharing) (directory) or [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10FZsCwsO4TkqHTJ1Q7w4Ae3xxo1IYOp0/view?usp=sharing) (most recent version).  

Unlike Google, Mozilla has a human being review extensions before publishing them to addons.mozilla.org, and there is a bit of a backlog.

Here are illustrations showing the steps:
