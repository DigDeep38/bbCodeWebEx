# Installation Instructions

The file has not yet been installed in addons.mozilla.org, so you must do one of the following:
* Download the zip file from GitHub, and rename from \*.zip to \*.xpi, and then load it from the about:debugging page by clicking on the page.
* Download the zip file from GitHub, unzip it into a directory, and then then load it from the about:debugging page by clicking on the manifest.JSON file in that directory.
* Download a privately signed file from Google Drive at TBD.  (Should be done by 1/7/19).

Unlike Google, Mozilla has a human being review extensions before publishing them to addons.mozilla.org, and there is a bit of a backlog.

Here are illustrations showing the steps:
